# VortX
This is VortX, an open-source 2D graphics library that uses C++. The code is not much right now but with some support from the community, this graphics library could be useful for 2D gamedev.
# What are the benefits of this graphics library?
This library is open-source, meaning that lots of people are constantly checking and error correcting code, as well as adding new features. This means that VortX could become a very advanced graphics library with a very low error rate in a decently short amount of time.
# How do i use this graphics library? 
instructions on using this library will not be provided in this repo right now, due to the fact VortX is currently is in a very early stage of development.
